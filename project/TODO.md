Basic:
* Rationalise the compiling of imports, so there's only one compile method (probably using parameters)
* Change the generator stack to only store the program name
* Do standard library imports in a less stupid way
* Modufy selection statements to allow any kind of statement, not just compound

Optimisation:
* Constant folding
* Constant propogation

Done:
* Migrate to gradle
